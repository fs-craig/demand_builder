The DemandRecord fields for demands from the CONSOLIDATED file
should come from
Demandgroup - always "Ungrouped"
Operation - MAP field "Scenarios and Vignettes"
Vignette - Event/Force List code

In this case, we should have

Demandgroup - Ungrouped
Operation - "B"
Vignette - "Beacon"

Instead we have

Demandgroup - Beacon
Operation - B
Vignette - Beacon
