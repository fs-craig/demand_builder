Want to check that if a Forge demand ends before the last day of the file, it isn't extended.
Before, this demand was getting extended, but it looks like Mike fixed that problem so
I'm double-checking that.

current issues:
01205-final duration should be 8.  It's 9.
98205-final duration should be 8.  It's 2920.
