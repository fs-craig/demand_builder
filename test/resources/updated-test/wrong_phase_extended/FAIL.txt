The duration of a next to last FORGE demand for SRC 01225K000 Ponies is 2 when
it should be 8.  Last demand should probably be 8 too.

Well, let's take a look at what the vignett MAP says.
MAP says 99 duration should be 91 and start day 1092 = End day of 1183
This is actually end day of the demand.

Are we letting the vignette map curtail and extend?
Yes. According to file 'Updates Dec17-Jan18.txt'
Expected output is edited as such.
