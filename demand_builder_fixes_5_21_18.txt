Forge - Error thrown if SRC has no demand (empty cells)
In vmap->forge-demands; 
	added check to see that demand data exist (line contains more than just header data)


Demand Builder 
	- Extend inccorecct when does not go for duration of final period 
	- Need to check for last day during last period
	- Currently extending last period regardless of end time

	Ex: 
		last phase
		100	101	102	103	
	SRC A:	1	1	1	1
	SRC B: 	2	2

*SRC A properly extended from 100 to MAP_END
*SRC B should not be extened (should end on 101)

In forge->lines and get-final-map-time; 
	checked that line contained data for last period in the last phase, 
	if needed to extend, true passed to get-final-map-time and final time set to what was in vignette map
	if no extend, false passed to get-final-map-time, returned start+duration of final period (less than map value)
